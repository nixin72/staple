;;; Commentary:
;; This package aims to provide users with a modern method of organizing
;; buffers and windows.
;;
;; Instead of having a global list of buffers that you can access from any
;; window, this package provides an abstraction over this by grouping
;; buffers by windows, which allows you to kill all buffers "stapled" to a window
;; at once, move buffers between windows, and isolate special buffers so that
;; you can better control where they are.
;; 
;; For example, if we have 4 buffers named buffer-1 through buffer-4, and the
;; following layout: 
;;
;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
