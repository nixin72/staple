;;; Commentary:
;; This package aims to provide users with a modern method of organizing
;; buffers and windows.
;;
;; Instead of having a global list of buffers that you can access from any
;; window, this package provides an abstraction over this by grouping
;; buffers by windows, which allows you to kill all buffers "stapled" to a window
;; at once, move buffers between windows, and isolate special buffers so that
;; you can better control where they are.
;; 
;; For example, if we have 4 buffers named buffer-1 through buffer-4, and the
;; following layout:
;;
;; +--------------------------+--------------------------+
;; | Window-1                 | Window-2                 |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |  Buffer-1 contents here  |  Buffer-3 contents here  |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |                          |                          |
;; +--------------------------+--------------------------+
;;
;; Then the normal behaviour for `previous-buffer' when in Window-1 would be to
;; cycle back to buffer-4.
;;
;; However, if buffer-1 and 2 are stapled to window-1, and buffer-3 and 4 are
;; stapled to window-2, then `staple-previous-buffer' in window-1 would cycle
;; back to buffer-2 instead of buffer-4.
;;
;; If you were in window-2, the same behaviour applies. If your current buffer
;; is buffer-3, and you call `staple-previous-buffer' in window-2, then
;; buffer-4 will become the selected buffer.
;;
;; Without being explicit, you cannot have a single buffer available in multiple
;; windows. If you call `staple-copy-buffer-to-window', then you can staple the
;; buffer to additional windows and have it cycle through in those windows.
;;
;;
;; In addition to this, it also provides any special buffers with their own
;; window. This way, when cycling through buffers in a file window, you won't
;; need to cycle through your compilation or dired buffers for example. Like in
;; a modern editor, you can have a dedicated space for that in a window across
;; the bottom of the frame for example:
;;
;; +--------------------------+--------------------------+
;; | Window-1                 | Window-2                 |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |  Buffer-1 contents here  |  Buffer-3 contents here  |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |                          |                          |
;; |                          |                          |
;; +--------------------------+--------------------------+
;; | Special window-3                                    |
;; |                                                     |
